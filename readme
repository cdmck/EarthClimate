This project expands a group final assignment in Professor Ian Bourg's CEE207/ENV207 - Introduction to Environmental Engineering - that created an Earth system model coupling the water, carbon, and heat cycles to accurately depict climate change over the next several thousand years and ultimately relating these climate parameters to calculate the social cost of carbon based on other economic parameters.

I worked with Joey Forzani, Anders Oja, Lucia Achucarro, and Abigail Roberts on the original project.

From this starting point, I implemented the Excel calculations using popular Python libraries to enhance their accuracy while adding features to visualize the impacts of economic parameters on the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere over time and the social cost of carbon and making it easier to change these parameters and notice the impacts quickly.
